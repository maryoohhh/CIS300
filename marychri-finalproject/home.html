		<h2>Heart attack</h2>
		<img id = "heart" src = "heart.jpg" height = "140" width = "260">
		<p>Heart attack occurs due to obstruction of blood flow to the heart. This could be caused by several factors such as build-up of fat, cholesterol, and other substances, which form a blockage in the coronary arteries that supplies blood to the heart. Obstruction of blood flow can damage part of the heart muscle. Also called myocardial infarction, heart attack can be fatal.</p>
		<p>Most heart attacks are caused by a condition known as coronary artery disease. This occurs when one or more of the coronary arteries become blocked or obstructed. Over time, coronary artery narrows due to the buildup of various substances.</p>

		<p>Every year, about <strong>790,000 Americans</strong> have a heart attack. Of these cases</p>
		<ul>
			<li>580,000 are first heart attack.</li>
			<li>210,000 happen to people who already had a previous heart attack.</li>
		</ul>

			<li>More than <strong>one million people</strong> in the United States alone <strong>suffer from a heart attack</strong> each year.</li><br>
			<li>Costs related to hert attack exceed <strong>60 billion dollars per year,</strong> which includes charges for hospitalization, doctors and prescription drugs.</li><br>
