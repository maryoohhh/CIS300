		<h2>What's expected?</h2>
		<p>An electrocardiogram or ECG is a painless, nonivasive way to help diagnose many common heart problems in people of all ages. Doctors may use an electrocardiogram to detect:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Irregularities in your heart rhythm or arrhythmias.</li><br>
			<li>If blocked or narrowed arteries in the heart or coronary artery disease are causing the chest pain or heart attack.</li><br>
			<li>Structural problems with the heart's chambers.</li><br>
			<li>A previous heart attack.<br></li>
			<li>How well certain ongoing heart disease treatments,such as a pacemaker, are working.<br></li>
		</ul>

		<a name = "risks"><h2>Risks</h2></a>
		<p>An electrocardiogram or ECG is a safe procedure. There is no risk of getting an electrical shock during the test because electrodes are placed on the body do not omit any electricity. They only record the electrical activity of the heart.</p>
		<p>Minor discomfort, similar to removing a bandage, when the electrodes are removed. A reaction due to the electrode adhesive may also be observed such as redness or swelling where the patches were placed.</p>

		<h3>During the ECG</h3>
		<p>This specific machine will let you perform ECG remotely at your own home to be transmitted to your doctor. It is best to perform the diagnosis when lying on a bed.</p>
		<p>3 electrodes will be attached to chest and stomach area. Electrodes are sticky patches that are applied to help record the electrical activity of the heart.</p>

		<h3>After the ECG</h3>
		<p>You can resume to your normal daily activities.</p>

		<a name = "results"><h2>Results</h2></a>
		<p>The machine will look for a consistent, even heart rhythm and a heart rate between 50 and 100 beats per minute. Having a faster, slower, or irregular heartbeat provides clues about the heart health, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Heart rate.</strong> ECG can help identify unusually fast heart rate or tachycardia, or an unusually slow heart rate or bradycardia.</li><br>
			<li><strong>Heart rhythm.</strong> ECG can show heart rhythm irregularities or arrhythmias. These conditions may occur when any part of the heart's electrical system malfunctions. Medications, such as beta blockers, cocaine, amphetamines, and over-the-counter cold and allergy drugs, can also trigger arrhythmias.</li><br>
			<li><strong>Heart attack.</strong> ECG can show evidence of a previous heart attack or one that's in progress. The patterns on the ECG may indicate which part of your heart has been damaged, as well as the extent of the damage.</li><br>
			<li><strong>Inadequate blood and oxygen supply to the heart.</strong> ECG done while you're having symptoms can help your doctor determine whether chest pain is caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, such as with the chest pain of unstable angina.</li><br>
			<li><strong>Structural abnormalities.</strong> ECG can provide clues about enlargement of the chambers or walls of the heart, heart defects and other heart problems.<br></li>
		</ul>
